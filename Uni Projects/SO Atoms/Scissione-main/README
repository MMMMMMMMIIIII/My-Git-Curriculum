This project is written in C. It consist of a simulation, where we have some initial atoms and we have to split
them. Splitting atoms produces energy, which is used to split other atoms. We have the master process, that monitor
the reactions and starts the other process. Then we have the attivatore, which activate the split of a certain
number of waiting atoms, and the alimentatore adds some atoms to the reaction. The master process prints some
information every second and the reaction can conclude with 4 status:
 - Timeout: limit time exceed
 - Blackout: too much energy required
 - Explode: too much energy produced
 - Meltdown: Any one of the executed fork fails
 This project taught me how to use tools like semaphore, message queues and signals.
