One of the first project was during second year, for the subject LFT (Linguaggi formali e traduttori).
The project was about build a working translator, which from a descripted language takes in input a
script and execute it, translating it first of all in jasmine, and then into java.
The project isn't just the translator, but all the other java classes are implemented to make the translator work.
The translator is written in java.
