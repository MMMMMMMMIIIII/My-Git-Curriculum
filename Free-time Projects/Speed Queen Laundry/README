During 2023 spring-summer, I developed a web infrastructure for my parents' laundry, composed of a web domain
and a web hosting. I developed the html, css (using Bootstrap) and javascript on my own, and I also used a phpmyadmin
database, which allowed me to create a log system, as well as making the website dynamically editable.
