During my last high school year, I applied for ABC Interactive, an innovative company that makes front and back
end system. My assignment consisted of develop a front-end website for the TEMI company, based on a prototype
created by the graphic design sector. That experience helps me a lot (and I think was more effective than 5 years
of high school), it teach me how to master the bootstrap framework. Unfortunately, my stage experience lasted only
1 month. However, I succeeded to finish the front-end side. This is the ultimate project:

I specify that I didn't finished this project, I only developed the 90% of the web pages and just the front side.
